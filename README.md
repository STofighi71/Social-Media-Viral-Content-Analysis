# 📊 Retail Sales Performance Analysis: Customer Behavior & Revenue Insights

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail transactional data to uncover sales patterns, customer behavior, and revenue drivers. The goal is to provide actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making for sales strategy, inventory planning, and business growth.

The analysis focuses on understanding how customers, products, and time-based factors influence overall retail performance.

## 🎯 Business Context

Retail businesses generate large volumes of transactional data, but without proper analysis, valuable insights often remain hidden. This project aims to bridge that gap by transforming raw transaction data into meaningful business intelligence.

The insights from this analysis can help decision-makers:
- Identify high-value customers
- Detect sales trends and seasonality
- Optimize product and pricing strategies
- Improve inventory and promotional planning
